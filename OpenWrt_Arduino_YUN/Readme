This folder contains instructions developed from notes taken during
testing and evaluating of the Arduino Yun. The Yun uses 2 micro-
controllers. An ATmega32u4 RISC and an Atheros AR9331 MIPS. The
Yun is a combination of the Arduino Leonardo with a WiFi router.
This marriage has many applications for (IoT) Internet of Things
using remote and automated controls with Internet interface. And
Internet distributed data loggers and processing.

The following functions have been addressed in these tests.
 * Conectivity with WiFi, Ethernet, async serial, and USB.
 * Arduino micro-code complie, link and upload.
 * Arduino IDE install and build/upload functions.
 * AVR toolchain use for micro-code complie, link and upload.
 * OpenWrt system function and upgrade on the Atheros.
 * The OpenWrt system build and install.
