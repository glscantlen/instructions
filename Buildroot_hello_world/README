This folder contains instructions for adding simple hello_world
applications to BuildRoot. There are 2 applications presented in
this instruction, hello & helloX. "hello" is an example of a console
application and "helloX" is a an X11 application. Included in this
folder are source code trees for each application. These instructions
were written for the XU3_MPlayer Buildroot configuration presented
in this repository. But they can be easily adapted to other BuildRoot
configurations. These applications will build and execute on both
host and target systems.
