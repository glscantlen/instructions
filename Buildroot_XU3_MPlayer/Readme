This folder contains instructions and associated files for building
a very simple media player on an Odroid-XU3. The media player is
built from mplayer/ffmpeg and youtube-dl. This system uses u-boot
for the bootloader and BuildRoot for building the root filesystem.
The instructions will build u-boot and kernal from the Hardkernel
repositories, external to BuildRoot.

These procedures were written to be executed on an Ubuntu 14.04 x86 desktop.
The target system will be placed onto a microSD that will boot the Odroid-XU3
and the system can be transfered to the Odroid-XU3 remotely. There is no
requirement to preform S/W development on the Odroid-XU3 itself. The
Odroid-XU3 will not require a previously installed system.
