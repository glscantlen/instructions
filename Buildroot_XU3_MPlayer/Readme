This folder contains instructions and associated files for building
a very basic media player on an Odroid-XU3. The media player is
built from mplayer/ffmpeg and youtube-dl. This system uses u-boot
for the bootloader and BuildRoot for building the root filesystem.
The instructions will build the kernel and u-boot from the Hardkernel
repositories, external to BuildRoot.

These procedures were written to be executed on an Ubuntu 14.04 x86
desktop. The target system will be placed onto a microSD that will
boot the Odroid-XU3. Alternatively, the system can be transfered to
the Odroid-XU3 remotely. There is no requirement to preform software
development on the Odroid-XU3 itself. The Odroid-XU3 will not require
a previously installed system.

 NOTICE: FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS INSTRUCTION WILL BE LIMITED.
         DUE TO THE LIMITATIONS OF SUBMODULES IT WAS DECIDED
         TO MOVE THESE INSTRUCTIONS TO A DEDICATED REPOSITORY.
         THE NEW INSTRUCTION REPOSITORY FOR XU3_MPLAYER WILL BE
         LOCATED AT:
         https://github.com/glscantlen/Buildroot_XU3_MPlayer_ins
