This repository contains instructions for building a variety
of Linux based systems and utilities. The instructions are
simple text files written in a human readable format, ending
with a '.ins' extension. These instructions do not require a
special program or GUI to view their content. One can view
the '.ins' files with any text file reader, editor or simply
'cat' the content.

The content of a '.ins' file was initially only a means for
taking notes or capturing procedures, with lots of copy-paste
from command line, history files, and other screen content.
The instructions in this repository are an adaptation to these
notes in an attempt to provide step-by-step procedures. The
steps in the procedures were meant to be followed one at a time.
There is no attempt to provide a copy-paste of multiple steps,
although most single steps can be executed with copy-paste.
The syntax used in these instruction will loosely follow the
structure described below:

 - Each step or entry begins with a multiple of 3-character
   indents, triplets, with exception to the top level section
   headers.

 - The triplet indents will be 3 spaces with exception to the
   last triplet on a line which identifies the procedure to
   be preformed in that step.
    $ Execute this line on the console/terminal
    # Comment. Don't do anything just acknowledge the comment.
    ! Important notice, like a high priority comment.
    - manual instruction or group of instructions
    ? IF/ELSE conditional procedures
       ! Procures contained within a condition or group will
         be preceded by one more triplet
       ! steps that contain a single instruction over multiple
         lines will follow on the next line, preceded by only
         spaces.
   _____________________________________________
 - Over-lined Header for separating into sections

 - In some cases a section could be entered out of order as
   though it were independent of previous sections. In this
   case a '###' triplet may precede steps that were expected
   to be preformed prior to the section.
