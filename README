This repository contains instructions for building a variety
of Linux based systems and utilities. The instructions are
simple text files written in a human readable format, ending
with a '.ins' extension. These instructions do not require a
special program or GUI to view their content. One can view
the '.ins' files with any text file reader, editor or simply
'cat' the content.

The content of a '.ins' file was initially meant for taking
notes or capturing procedures, with lots of copy-paste from
command line, history & log files, and other screen content.
The instructions in this repository are an adaptation to these
notes in an attempt to provide step-by-step procedures. The
steps in the procedures were meant to be followed one at a time.
There is no attempt to provide a copy-paste of multiple steps,
although most single steps can be executed with copy-paste.
The syntax used in these instruction will closely follow the
structure described below:

 - Each step or entry begins with a multiple of 3-character
   indents, triplets, with exception to the top level section
   headers.

 - The triplet indents will be 3 spaces with exception to the
   last triplet on a line which identifies the procedure to
   be preformed in that step. For example:

    $ Execute this line on the console/terminal. Can copy-paste
    # Comment. Don't do anything. This is only a comment.
    ! Important notice. A very important comment.
    - manual instruction or group of instructions
    ? IF/ELSE conditional procedures
       ! Procures contained within a condition or group will
         be preceded by one more triplet
       ! Steps that contain a single instruction over multiple
         lines will follow on the next line, preceded by only
         spaces.

   _____________________________________________
 - Over-lined Header for separating into sections

    # In some cases a section or group of steps might be entered
      out of sequence and this procedure may not be independent
      of previous procedures. For that case a '###' triplet will
      precede steps that were expected to be preformed prior to
      entering that section.

 - Many instructions will require steps that edit configuration
   files with a text editor. These steps will typically use "nano"
   for the editor although other editors could be used.

    # In cases where the configuration file is new and too large
      for manual entry, a down-loadable file will be provided in
      the repository.

    # in cases where the configuration file already exists, a
      comment may be used to instruct what part of the file is
      changed. Following the "nano" edit command will be the text
      that is the be changed. This text will be preceded by the
      correct number of triplet spaces to indicate a single step
      over multiple lines. The text that is entered into the
      configuration file will not have these preceding spaces.

    # In cases where the procedures are too difficult for a single
      step manual edit, there will be provided scripts, patches,
      or appended instructions to provide the detail.
